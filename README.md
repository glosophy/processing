Yes, that's right. I am currently following several tutorials and courses that I find very helpful. (List coming up soon.) In the meantime, I will start updating this `README.md` with images of the posters. 

## I : lila Wolken
I started playing around with de Jong and Clifford attractors. I find it fascinating how beautiful math is. It suprises me every time.

A combination of different random numbers applied to the concepts of acceleration, velocity, and position.
